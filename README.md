The Sinclair ZX Spectrum clones that came out of the Soviet/post-Soviet regions tended to use 14MHz crystals as these could be used to generate an easy 7MHz and 3.5MHz signal.<br>

These 14MHz crystals are not easy to obtain now (obsolete) in their original package type, but are available as surface mount devices.<br>

So I thought I might see if it's possible to use them to replace suspect 14MHz crystals in these Eastern Bloc clones.<br>
